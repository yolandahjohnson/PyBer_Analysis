# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

An analysis of ride share data for PyBer was evaluated to compare the number of rides and the fares amongst urban, suburban, and rural communities within the cities. To do a proper evaluation, two datasets were utilized: city data and ride data. The city data contained the cities, the number of drivers and the city type. The ride data contained the cities, dates, fares, and ride id. These two data sets were merged in order to get all the data in one dataset. The final analysis shows the total weeky fares for each city type for January-April 2019. 

## Results

To begin the analysis, city_data.csv dataset and ride_data.csv dataset was combined and totals were obtained for each type of city.
- The data shows that urban cities have far more total rides, drivers and fares than rural and suburban cities. 
- The data shows that while urban cities receive more in total fares, the average fare per ride is lower that both rural and suburban cities.

A multiple-line graph was created to show the Total Fare by City Type for each city type. The graph fully illustrates that urban cities bring in approximately $1,700 or more consitently for the months of January, February, March, and April 2019. Whereas, urban cities brought in a maximum of $500 or less throughout the months of January, February, March,and April 2019.

## Summary

In analysing the data, first assumptions would be that urban cities are more profitable in the ride-sharing business. However, when you take a closer look, you see that urban cities are saturated with drivers. There are a reported 2,405 drivers in urban cities, however there were only 1,625 rides. That shows that some drivers did not have a rider and did not earn a fare. If the number of drivers were reduced in urban cities, this would create more of a demand which could result in an increase in fares.
